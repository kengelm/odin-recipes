    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>As the winter months drag on, I find myself needing a hardier snack food--fruit just
        won't cut it! Instead of reaching for something that I will mindlessly eat like
        potato chips, I make ths chili cheese bean dip to keep my guests and me satiated 
        until dinner time. It is packed with flavour and protein and is an excellent crowd-pleaser. 
        This recipes is from <a href="https://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2024/02/chili-cheese-bean-dip-because-one-layer.html">Chef John's website Food Wishes</a>.
